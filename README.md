## Description

- Started from scratch for everything we needed to us HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a quiz.
- A lot of buttons where made with event listeners to guide the code through the quiz.
- Once the quiz was over you had an option to submit your score and save it in the highscores page.
- Prevent default and localStorage where used to store values and prevent them from disappearing.

## Installation
- The best practive was to start with the HTML so I could see what I was beginning with and adding from there
